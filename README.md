# Animation

For this game, I had the idea for bouncing the ball from right to left to score points.
The objective of the game is simple: collect the acorns in the hole on the right side of the screen.
Acorns will spawn on the left and you control the wooden pegs that pop up from the bottom.
You use the momentum from the pegs to propel the acorn to the right. Try to line it up with the goal
because the hole on the tree moves up and down. As your score increases, the acorns will spawn
more frequently. Each point you score will make acorns spawn 1/20th of a second faster.

Most of the satisfaction with this project came from the design aspects. I created all of the visual
elements myself, and it was fun to tinker with the physics of the acorns. I had to figure out how to
make the acorns constantly move to the left as you hit them. I also had to figure out how to make
the hole work by layering images on top of each other to make it look like the acorn goes into the
hole. After getting the game to work, I had to solve the different states of the game: title screen,
game active, and game over.

If I had to continue working, I would like to add more sound effects to collisions and add golden
acorns that are worth more points. I like the way the game runs, but I feel there is no reward for
doing well.

The background music that plays is called "Banana Breeze" by Vexento.
